Instructions: [up3dtools-how-to](http://stohn.de/3d/index.php/2016/03/10/up3dtools-little-how-to)

This command line tools support printers from Tiertime see http://www.up3d.com for more information. It allows you to use other advanced slicers together with your UP printer. The tools process and upload standard G-Code files to your UP printer.

A packaged GUI frontend myUP.app for OS X is available under downloads. It allows to explore interactively the various transcoder settings.

## up3dtranscode: 

G-Code to UpMachineCode (UMC) converter
```
Usage: up3dtranscode machinetype input.gcode output.umc nozzleheight [a_factor] [vmax_factor] [junction]

          machinetype:  mini / classic / plus / box / Cetus
          input.gcode:  g-code file from slic3r/cura/simplify
          output.umc:   up machine code file which will be generated
          nozzleheight: nozzle distance from bed (e.g. 123.45)
          a_factor:     acceleration factor in percent to defaults (.e.g. 50)
          vmax_factor:  speed factor in percent to max defaults (e.g. 150)
          junction:     junction deviation, default is 0.05 (e.g. 0.1)          

example: up3dtranscode mini input.gcode output.umc 123.1  20  150  0.1
         this reads input.gcode and generates an output.umc for the UP mini with nozzle height
         set to 123.1. The acceleration for the printer is reduced to 20%, max speed is set to
         150% and junction deviation is set to 0.1

## up3dinfo: 

Program to show the details of the connected UP printer
```
Usage: up3dinfo
```
---

## up3dstatus

Program to show current print status and to control the printer
```
Usage: ./up3dstatus [stop | on | off]

        stop:  stops current print and reports status
        on:    switch printer on and reports status
        off:   switch printer off and reports status
        no parameter reports current printer status:
        <machine>;<program>;<system>;<temp>;<layer>;<height>;<percent>;<time>
        <machine>: machine state 
        <program>: program state 
        <system>:  numeric value machine state 
        <temp>:    current nozzle temperture in C
        <layer>:   reported printing layer
        <height>:  reported printing height in mm
        <percent>: reported completion in percent
        <time>:    reported time remaining in seconds
```

## up3dconvg

Program to convert UP machine code to standard g-code for e.g. review

```
Usage: up3dconvg machinetype input.umc

        machinetype:  mini / classic / plus / box / Cetus
        input.gcode:  up machine code file which will be read
```
---

## up3dcapture

Program to capture the axis positions during a running print. The capture sapling rate is ca 2ms. The capture stops automatically when the printer returns into idle mode.

```
Usage: up3dcapture
```
---

## up3dgcode

Program to process captured data from up3dcapture to g-code. It uses some advanced filtering to generate larger segments.

```
Usage: togcode input.capture [average]
         input.capture:  machine capture file
         average: not implemented yet
```
