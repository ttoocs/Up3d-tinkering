# Up3d-tinkering
Playing around with up3d. 

# TODO

-Create a library from the two subtree'd files.
  -To the point it can command-bang out a printed object

-Figure out how to actually "push" the object. (Seems to be a bit harder for the plus... some some 28kb error... tell it to ignore it entierly.. kinda works... also having the printer move about also helps to get it passed... and so does just sending everything at once.)

-Document all the things.
